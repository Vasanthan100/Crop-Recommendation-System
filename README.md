##                                   Crop Recommendation System
A Flask application designed to help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection based on productivity and season. This application utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors and provide personalized crop recommendations for optimal yield.


## üöÄProject Structure
The project follows a standard Flask application structure:

 - app/: Contains the main application files.
   - static/: Stores static files such as CSS stylesheets and images.
   - templates/: Contains HTML templates for the user interface.
   - init.py: Initializes the Flask application.
   - crop_recommendation.py: Implements the crop recommendation logic.
   - models/: Stores pre-trained machine learning models (e.g., your_model.pkl).
   - utils.py: Includes utility functions used within the application.
 - venv/: Virtual environment directory for Python dependencies.
 - app.py: Main application script to run the Flask server.
 - requirements.txt: Lists all Python packages required for the project. Install these using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## üíªSystem Requirements:

Ensure that system meets the following requirements before running the Agricultural Crop Recommendation System:

*   Python 3.7 or higher 
*   Pip (Python package installer) 
*   Flask 
*   Required libraries listed in the requirements.txt fileüóíÔ∏è
